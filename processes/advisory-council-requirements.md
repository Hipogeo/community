# Governance Scope Advisory Council Recommendations

The AVCs have already done some work on these. I doubt that I’m providing anything groundbreaking here that the AVCs between them haven’t already covered.

## Scope Requirements
* Scope Advisory Council Members must have ‘relevant skills for providing professional expert input on the content of the Governance Scope’
* Scope Advisory Council Members must be paid on a per-project basis.
* Projects must ‘improve all or specific parts of the Governance Scope.’
* Work does not need to be compatible with the Scope Artifact format.
* Must have a ‘high probability of producing clearly measurable value’ in order to receive funding.

EITHER in-depth subject knowledge of the crypto space, the Ethereum blockchain, and MakerDAO AND general familiarity with traditional governance structures, processes, and publications;

OR in-depth subject knowledge of traditional governance structures, processes, and publications AND general familiarity with the Ethereum blockchain and MakerDAO.

It is critically important that candidates both:

* are able to find relevant information;  

…when it relates to both of these two domains (crypto and traditional governance).
