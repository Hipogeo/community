# Endgame Arbitration Thoughts

## Key Goals
* Reduce the number of arbitration votes MKR Holders need to participate in.
* Reduce the number of arbitration votes subDAO token Holders need to participate in.
* Reduce the workload for facilitators as much as possible.
* Arbitration should be available to all, despite their financial resources.
* Transparent in its processes and outcomes.
* Spam protection to prevent the arbitration system from getting bogged down in petty/spurious complaints.


## Arbitration Pairs

When developing the arbitration framework it’s important to try to consider all of the possible participants in advance. It’s hard to say how many of these will be applicable exactly, given the uncertainty around how subDAOs and ecosystem actors will develop. 

**Possible Pairs**
* Core vs. subDAO
* Core vs. Ecosystem Actor
* subDAO A vs. subDAO B
* subDAO vs. Ecosystem Actor
* Ecosystem Actor A vs. Ecosystem Actor B
* subDAO vs External Actor
* Ecosystem Actor vs External Actor

## Escalation and Appeals

Any arbitration framework should likely involve some sort of system of escalation such that arbitration can take place at various levels depending on the scale of the stakes. The goal here is one of efficiency: to reduce the number of arbitration cases that require intervention from tokenholders. 

Escalation could take place through a system of appeals. In this, it’s important to trade off against two goals:

1. The goal of making arbitration fair and available to all participants.
2. Protecting the arbitration process from spam. 

Costless appeals will likely lead to spam (well-intentioned or otherwise), whereas costly appeals require a level of capital to be provided by the participants, leading the arbitration process to favor those with more resources.

A hybrid system is possible in which a committee or facilitator can set the cost for appeal more flexibly depending on the relative financial circumstances of the participants, though this does introduce the risk of bias on the part of the deciding party.


## Outsourcing

It may be possible to outsource arbitration to preexisting DAOs that provide this service as their primary objective. Such outsourcing has its own advantages and disadvantages.

**Advantages**
* Potentially more objective
* May be cheaper than running the process in-house.

**Disadvantages**
* Less control
* Less familiarity with Maker
