# Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP84) - November 14, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, November 14 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP40c3-SP84 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*MIP40c3-SP84 renews the Governance Communications Core Unit (COM-001) budget from January 1st, 2023, through June 30th, 2023, and follows the latest MIP40 amendment. This budget proposal recognizes the DAOâ€™s intent to cut costs with a significant bottom-line budget reduction of approximately -23%. We reduced the number of full-time salaried employees to two while expanding the part-time contributor budget from 70k to 120k. These changes ensure we can still execute the active pieces of our mandate while growing in our most impactful activities.*
